## Introduction

**Trackifi** is a personal finance web app that empowers users to manage income, track expenses, set budgets, and gain financial insights through intuitive visualizations.

The **frontend** is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, offering a fast and responsive user experience. The **backend** is powered by **Spring Boot (Java)** and connects to a cloud-hosted **Neon PostgreSQL** database. The backend is **containerized with Docker** and published on **Docker Hub**.

The project is developed in three progressive stages:
1. **Basic Transaction Tracking**
2. **Categorized Analytics**
3. **Monthly Budgeting & Insights**
